# Inhabitent

A WordPress custom theme developed during my class at Red Academy.

## GOALS
This site has been created to learn how to create a customized wordpress theme, building custom plugings to be able to add custom fields to the products, and creating custom widgets which the client would be able to change the opening hours, contact details or social links.

### TECHNOLOGY USED

Wordpress | PHP | WP Plugings | JQuery | HTML5 | CSS3 |  Sass (CSS Preprocessors) | Git | Github | Gulp |FontFace |


### PERSONAL LEARNINGS

PHP
Wordpress technology:
Functions, Hooks, Debugging, Post Types, Taxonomies and Fields
WP Custom Widgets
WP Custom Plugings
Mixins
Variables in SCSS
JQuery

Working with WP can be very challenging in terms of the number of files to keep track of. Ensuring we style only the specific class, page is meticulous work. Learning to use mixins and variables helps to save time and make our code easier to read.
